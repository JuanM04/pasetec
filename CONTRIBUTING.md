# Contributing to PaseTec

Contributing is quite simple, you need to know how to use Git and GitHub (and a few more thing if you have to write code):
- When writing code, make sure that you are formatting all the files with Prettier (using the configuration in `.prettierrc`).
- If you don't understand how something work, read the `README` accordingly. You may found some useful links to more documentation.
- Follow the templates (please). To get the pull request template, add `?template=template.md` at the end of your URL after you selected both branches.
- Be nice ;)
